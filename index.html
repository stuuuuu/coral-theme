                        <p>Whilst the majority of people do gamble safely and responsibly, for some, gambling can become
                            a problem. When gambling, always remember the following</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gambling should be entertaining and fun and not seen as a way of making money</li>
                            <li>Only gamble what you can afford to lose</li>
                            <li>Avoid chasing losses</li>
                            <li>Keep track of the time and amount you spend gambling<br /> </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you are concerned about your gambling, then honestly answering the questions below may
                            give you an idea of whether your gambling is problematic:<br /> </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do you stay away from work, college or school to gamble?</li>
                            <li>Do you gamble to escape from a boring or unhappy life?</li>
                            <li>When gambling and you run out of money, do you feel lost and in despair and need to
                                gamble again as soon as possible?</li>
                            <li>Do you gamble until your last penny is gone, even the fare home or the cost of a cup of
                                tea?</li>
                            <li>Have you ever lied to cover up the amount of money or time you have spent gambling?</li>
                            <li>Have others ever criticised your gambling?</li>
                            <li>Have you lost interest in your family, friends or hobbies?</li>
                            <li>Do arguments, frustrations or disappointments make you want to gamble?</li>
                            <li>Do you feel depressed or even suicidal because of your gambling?</li>

                        <h1>What is GAMSTOP?</h1>

                        <p><u><a href="http://www.gamstop.co.uk/">GAMSTOP</a></u>&nbsp;is the UK&rsquo;s national online
                            self-exclusion scheme.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a tool that prevents access to online gambling sites
                            in the UK. GAMSTOP is run by a non-profit organisation called The National Online
                            Self-Exclusion Scheme Limited.<br /> </p>
                        <p><strong>What happens when someone registers with GAMSTOP</strong><br /> Consumers who
                            register with this scheme are blocked from most online gambling sites operating in Great
                            Britain (England, Scotland, Wales). The service offers consumers the choice to exclude from
                            online gambling for periods of 6 months, 1 year or 5 years.<br /> <br /> <strong>How does it
                                work?</strong> <br /> Personal details are logged and held by GAMSTOP, and each time
                            there is an attempted login or registration using these details, the GAMSTOP database is
                            checked. If there is a match the login/registration activity is blocked.<br /> <br /> If
                            someone were logged into their existing account when the GAMSTOP registration completed,
                            then they would be timed out within 24 hours. From that point onwards they would not be able
                            to log in.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;<br /> If you are an existing customer and register with GAMSTOP, you will continue to
                            receive marketing and promotional materials until you notify us you have registered with
                            GAMSTOP or try to log in. This is because GAMSTOP is an independent scheme and we can only
                            identify a customer has registered when they attempt to log in or notify us. Once we mark
                            your account(s) as self-excluded by GAMSTOP, we will cease all marketing and promotional
                            activity, and you will be unable to use any online/omnichannel services where a login is
                            involved. Any outstanding funds in your balance will be returned via your chosen deposit
                            method.<br /> <br /> It is important that you let us know if you are registered with GAMSTOP
                            as soon as possible so that we can:</p>
                        <p>freeze your account</p>
                        <p>return any remaining funds to you</p>
                        <p>stop sending you marketing and promotional materials</p>
                        <p>New customers who have signed-up with GAMSTOP will not be able to register with any of our
                            online brands, including any multichannel products. We have updated our General T&amp;Cs to
                            include use of the GAMSTOP scheme.<br /> <br /> <strong>How do consumers contact
                                GAMSTOP?</strong><br /> Full contact details for the service are available from the
                            website. The GAMSTOP website address is&nbsp;<a
                                href="http://www.gamstop.co.uk/">www.gamstop.co.uk</a><br /> </p>
                        <p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong><strong>(FAQs)<br /> <br /> I have registered with
                                GAMSTOP and want to withdraw my remaining funds; how do I get these
                                funds?</strong><br /> If you follow the login process until you see the error message
                            that blocks your login, then your funds will automatically be returned to your current
                            registered payment method within 5 working days. If you have more than one account, this
                            would need to be done for each of your accounts separately.<br /> <br /> Alternatively, you
                            can <a href="mailto:responsiblegambling@galacoral.com">email</a> us, and we will process the
                            refund manually for you. Please include your account details such as; name, username and
                            date of birth in your correspondence.</p>
                        <p>If you have no payment method to refund, the funds will remain in your account until you
                            provide us with your bank details in order to transfer the funds back to you. To provide
                            your bank details or for further information on refunding your balance please get in touch
                            with us via e-mail.<br /> <br /> <strong>I registered with GAMSTOP and want to start
                                gambling again, how can I do this?</strong><br /> The first step is to contact GAMSTOP
                            to discuss this and arrange to de-register from the scheme once your exclusion period
                            expires. Once your exclusion is lifted with GAMSTOP, you will be able to contact us to
                            reactivate your account, or if you are a new customer you will be able to register.<br />
                            <br /> <strong>I registered with GAMSTOP but can&rsquo;t remember when my
                                self</strong><strong>-exclusion expires, can you tell me?</strong><br /> Unfortunately,
                            we can&rsquo;t. We don&rsquo;t hold any information about the length of your exclusion, you
                            will need to contact GAMSTOP to get this information.<br /> <br /> <strong>I have not
                                registered with GAMSTOP but I have been told that my acco</strong><strong>unt is blocked
                                due to GAMSTOP, can you help?</strong><br /> We do not hold any details for GAMSTOP
                            self-exclusions and cannot amend or lift any exclusions that have been applied. You will

                                doing this?</strong><br /> GAMSTOP is an independent service meaning we don&rsquo;t hold
                            any information about who has or has not registered with them. As soon as we are informed
                            that you are registered with GAMSTOP, we will stop sending marketing communications. If you
                            try to login to your account this will automatically trigger an account block and prevent
                            any future marketing communications, or you can email us to let us know that you have
                            self-excluded via GAMSTOP and we will act accordingly.<br /> <br /> If you would like to

                            registered with GAMSTOP</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;<br /> <strong>I registered with GAMSTOP 12 months ago and you have taken money from my
                                account?</strong><br /> GAMSTOP is an independent service, meaning we don&rsquo;t hold
                            any information about who has or has not registered with them. If accounts remain open with
                            no activity, we may apply dormancy fees. As soon as we are informed that you are registered
                            with GAMSTOP, we will freeze your account and return any fees. If you try to login to your
                            account this will automatically trigger an account block and prevent any future marketing

                            have self-excluded from online gambling with GAMSTOP, you will not be able to bet in a
